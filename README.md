# Sweet-Tooth

The GIPHY API is used to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs. I went with a treat theme! There are 10 kinds of treats that are ultimately buttons. When a button is clicked, 10 gif images appear. Clicking on a gif will allow animation. Clicking again will stop animation. Each gif has a rating. The user is able to add a treat which will create a button once submitted. When the new button is clicked, 10 relative gif images appear.
